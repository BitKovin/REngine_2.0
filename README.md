This repository contains code of REngine 2. It's evolution of my previous RetroEngine that was written in C#.

Core improvements of this version:

1. Jolt Physics as main physics engine (Instead of outdated Bullet Physics)
2. Full Quake 3 BSP map format support (including lightmaps, light volumes, precomputed visibility and additional rendering optimizations)
3. Behavior Tree editor
4. Emscripten compilation support with experimental multi-threading
5. Improved animation blending and playback
6. Native OpenGL ES 3.0 and OpenGL 4+ renderer (to support both desktop and browser with possibility of mobile using Angle)
7. Mobile control

This repository also contains modified versions of used libraries and tools.
Most important modifications:
1. Fixed import of gltf2 and glb2 formats by disabling gltf1 and glb1 formats in Assimp. Platforms like Linux and Emscipten used wrong importer.
2. Disabled remove of coplanar faces on dynamic entities (any entity that isn't worldspawn) in q3map2.
3. Increated max lightvol amount in q3map2.
