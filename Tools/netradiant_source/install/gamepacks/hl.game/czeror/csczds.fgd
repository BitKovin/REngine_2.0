//
//		:INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANT THINGS:
//
// Finally, the FGD is done! I'd like to thank all those that have helped me get this FGD into a more complete state. I am planning on updating this
// When I have more information or something to fix. So please check back as there might be an update waiting for you!
// There are most likely a lot of missing things and undocumented stuff. I've tried to include as much information on the entities in the help section of JACK.
// If anyone who was a dev of CS:CZDS and has any knowledge of any data or insights into the specifics of it, please contact me ('I have a plan') at the TWHL forum/discord.
//  
// 
//		:A WORD FROM CASTLE: FORMER LD FOR RITUAL ENTERTAINMENT:
//
// A few days ago I had the honour of talking with CASTLE, the former LD for many of the levels in CS:CZDS, here is a snippet of what he said about CS:CZ.
//
// 'When we got the Gearbox build, they had practically finished the game and just that would have been great, but we went at it with a machete and cut a lot of the content. 
// Valve told us to make a HL1 experience in the Counter-Strike world and what we delivered was very far from it. There was no connection 
// to the previous levels, no 'Show, don't tell' theories in the levels, characters constantly spewing lore and there was always an objective to do. So it 
// was never really a HL1 experience. It was a super linear, mostly scripted game with annoying sections that didn't need to be there.
//
// At the time, we had too much power and we were way too ambitious when it came to CZ. For example, The AI was over scripted, the first time a dude falls down the stairs is cool,
// but the hundreth time is just frustrating. We didn't need to have a .SEQ file system or anything like that, Mutimanagers would have worked for everything.
// The same thing can be said about the annoying stealth sections, we didn't need those and the game would had probably done better without them. 
// If you do remake or port the levels, make sure to get rid of the fail state stealth parts for good.
// After CZ got taken out of our hands, they released our work as 'Deleted Scenes'. Till this day I have no idea why they decided to do that, it is what it is, but I would have liked it to be under a different name.'
//
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
//		:DETAILS AND NOTES:
//
// Release version: 1.1.6 'Another One' Edition
// Release date: 16/7/2023
// Authors: cs_expert-tom793 : 小冬冬 / Dong : I have a plan : Castle 
//
// This FGD is for Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes. 
// !Please use either J.A.C.K or equivalent modern goldsource level editor. There is a rather large limitation in Hammer 3.5!
// !Regarding this FGD and it is quite hard to fix without running 3rd party code at buildtime!
// 
//
//		:MISSING/UNKNOWN KEYS, VALUES AND SPAWNFLAGS:
//
// Unfortunatly, I am not an expert in reading decompiled code. Some keys, values and spawnflags will be missing or have no 'Help' information.
// I would need the old UberRadiant .def that Ritual Entertainment used. But, we will never fully know what they were/ or do until the .def or SDK is found/given to us by Valve.
// I'm very sorry if there are missing keys, values or spawnflags. I'll continue trying to find the contacts I need to speak to in order to complete this.
// List of keys that are used in the game files!
//
//!NOTE! CBaseTrigger Still trying to work out what they do!!
//> CBaseTrigger (Things like trigger_once, trigger_multiple, etc...) >> QUERY TARGET NEEDS TO BE SET FOR THESE TO WORK!!!!
//	- isdead > ???  something about a deadflag, could be a normal trigger condition ???
//	- hasclassname > if classname is 'xyz', trigger this (this one is a bit tricky. >> SEEMS TO WORK SOMETIMES WITH Terrorist_xyz)
//	- usingweapon > Takes the weapon model (v/w/p_m4a1.mdl) AS the input value??? > Could seems to be related to the Monster `weapon` KV.
//	- takingdamage > Seems to be under the normal trigger condtions of the monster.
//	- hearcombat > Seems to be under the normal trigger condtions of the monster.
//	- enemyisplayer > Seems to be under the normal trigger condtions of the monster.
//	- hearplayer > Seems to be under the normal trigger condtions of the monster.
//
//	>monster_T/CT
//	- poisoned (Causes Crash on level load IF not paired with healthModifier)
//	- pumped // ???
//	- blastradius //m_blastRadius// > seems the code is gimped
//	- blastdamage //m_blastDamage// > seems the code is gimped
//
//
//	> monster_hostage
//	- rescueanim (code suggests it should work, if the string corresponds to an animation.)
//
//	> func_healthcharger + func_recharge
//	- dmdelay (code suggests that func_recharge is supported, but not func_healthcharger.)
//
//
//		:SKILLS.CFG:
//
// The skills.cfg can be used in a custom mod to define certain properties within CS:CZDS. Some entites in this FGD are tagged with a 'help'
// dialog that can be accessed in JACK that will let you know. But, here is a quick reference list. 
//	- sk_hgrunt_health (CT/T health)
//	- sk_turret_health (Turret health)
//	- sk_miniturret_health (Turret health)
//	- sk_sentry_health (Turret health)
//	- sk_suitcharger (Armor charger amount)
//	- sk_battery1 (Armor pickup amount)
//	- sk_healthkit (Healthkit pickup amount)
//	- sk_scientist_heal (Scientist 'syringe boost' amount)
//	- sk_plr_buckshot (Player shotgun)
//
//		:CONVERTING BRUSH ENTITIES TO POINT ENTITIES:
//
// Make a point entity where you would like.
// Write down the origin of the entity.
// Change the name of the entity to the func_* one you would like.
// Add the corresponding model to the model key field.
// Treat "body" and "skin" how you would with a normal studiomodel entity.
// Make sure you add the "origin" of your point
// entity to this one as they don't get saved by default.
// :WARNING:
// You will not be able to see the entity next time you
// load it on Hammer. Next time you save, the origin will be erased.
//
//		:INFO_TEXLIGHTS:
//
// This entity can act as a replacement for a lights.rad file, in that it simply resides within the map as a point based entity.
// The usefulness of this is that each map can have its own unique ambient lighting applied to it, and those settings will travel with the map and not affect any other maps.
// Usage of the entity is much like that of the multimanager. 
// To add an entry (take smart-edit off if you are using the Valve Hammer Editor/Worldcraft) and add key-value pairs in manually;
// The key should contain the name of the texture to apply lighting to, and the value a set of numbers representing the red green blue lumionsity(brightness) of the texture. 
// Just as you would in the lights.rad file.
//
//		:PVS:
//
// For a better understanding of what PVS is or might do in the case of NPCs, read this article from the Valve Developer Wiki: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/PVS
// Most of the time, the key should always be set to 'Yes'. No need to change it.
// Strangely enough, it would seem that the PVS on the monstermaker entity may not have implemented PVS (Due to a 'NoImpl' not left on the original FGD).
// 
// 'the 'nopvs' keyvalue seems to be used in conjunction with the fiber optic camera so npcs are still visible when they're in an area that the player can't see
// since there's a bug where cameras still use the player position for visibility testing this is used to get things to still render
// if an entity isn't including in visibility testing it always gets added to the list of visible entities' -SOLOKILLER
//
//		:TRIGGER_ZIPLINE (AKA FANCY TELEPORTER):
//
// The zipline is too broken and is pretty much a fancy teleporter. But here is how to use it.
// 1. Make a brushentity and set to trigger_zipline, Start = 1, End = 0 to set the start of the zipline anim.
//
// 2. Make a second trigger_zipline and Start = 0, End = 1 to set the end. (doesnt matter where this is and give it a name)
//
// 3. Make an info_target entity and set its name to something. Go back to the 1st zipline and make the Zipline Targets name to the Info_targets name. 
//
// 4. Make some sort of trigger with a delay (eg, Trigger_relay: target the name of the 2nd trigger_zipline and give it x delay). 
//
// 5. Try it out in the game! Big thanks to SoloKiller and Shepard for the assist!
//
//		:TRIGGER_OBJECTIVE:
//
// Here is a quick guide to make a set of objectives if you are making a mod:
// 1. Make the objective sentence group in the 'czeror_eng file'. for example:
// Aidev objective text
//"OBJ1_AIDEV_NEW"	"NEW OBJECTIVE: Proceed to elevator for training"
//"OBJ1_AIDEV"	"[ ] OBJECTIVE: Proceed to elevator for training"
//"OBJ1_AIDEV_COMPLETE"	"[X] OBJECTIVE: Proceed to elevator for training"
//
// 2. Make a .SEQ file for your map. Set the sequence block to look like this:
//%objseq
//{
//	@ObjectiveStyle
//	#text = "#OBJ1_AIDEV_NEW" //#text = "NEW OBJECTIVE: Proceed to elevator for training"
//	#firetargets = "obj1" //adds objective to objectives list
//}
//
// 3. Make a trigger_sequence and fill in the name, sequence file name (should be 'YOURMAPNAMEHERE.seq') and the sequence name (should be 'objseq').
//    Then make an trigger_objective, fill in the Name key as 'obj1' and the Objective key as '#OBJ1_AIDEV'. This selects the objective group to travel though.
//	  Then make a trigger_once and target the trigger_sequence. When the player walks through the trigger, it will alert the player to a new objective and will add it to the GUI.
// 4. To complete the objective, we need to retrigger the trigger_objective. Make a new trigger_once and put it somewhere and make it target the trigger_objective. When the player moves
//    through this trigger_once, it will retrigger the trigger_objective, making it complete.
//
//		:TRIGGER_SEQUENCE:
//
// I would recommended reading up about how .SEQ files work, and how to script them here: https://twhl.info/wiki/page/Tutorial%3A_Scripting_with_sequence_files
//
//		:'SUIT OF ARMOR' BUG:
// The 'Suit Of Armor' bug refers to the player picking up a battery and not having his armor count deplete when receiving damage. This is because of old HEV suit code.
// The fix for this is to always give or place armor at the start of the game/level/mod. This 'enables' the 'HEV suit' and makes batteries work as intended. 
//
//		:MAPTIER KEY:
//
// This is an interesting key. The code suggests that, depending on the number given, enemy behavior and schedules are changed. 
//
//		:ENV_PARTICLE CRASH:
// 
// Potential fix : Load into a different map that doesn't have an env_particle entity, prior to loading into a map with env_particle.
// Perma fix isn't going to be availible until I get an SDK from Valve.
//
//		:ITEM_GENERIC FOG FIX:
//
// Here is how to fix item_generic not interacting with fog properly. Go into the entity properties and give it these settings.
//	> Target Name : all_level_models
//  > Render Mode : Color
//	> FX Amount : 255
//	> Light Multiplier : 1
//	> Model : (whatever model you want)
//
//		:BULLETPROOF GLASS FIX:
//
// There seems to be a bug with func_breakable that deletes certain entities (in this case, a live grenade) from interacting with it. Go into the entity properties and give it these settings.
// THESE NEED TO BE SET IN KEYVALUE MODE (No smart-edit)
//	> grenadetouch : 0
//  > renderamt : (Whatever you want)
//	> rendermode : 2
//	> material : 7

//	- func_recharge uses HEV sounds.
//	- Monster_sentry doesn't precache it's firing sound properly.  >  Dodgy fix is to make 3 ambient_generics with the hks1/2/3 sounds in them !!!Can't fix unless Valve gives the CZEROR SDK!!!
//	- env_particle throws this error on map load sometimes > 'Tried to create message with bogus message type (0)'. !!!Can't fix unless Valve gives the CZEROR SDK!!!
//	- env_particle disappears when in players view, no fix as of yet.
//	- Unlocked sounds on doors and buttons seem to be broken. > !!!Can't fix unless Valve gives the CZEROR SDK!!!
//	- player_weaponstrip: some things [weapon_blowtorch/weapon_camera/] dont seem to work and crash the game.
//	- Item_soda needs to have a can.mdl in the active directory. Easy fix, move the can.mdl from HL1 into the mod directory
//
//		:1.1.x 'x' x : Candidate Release version list:
//
//	> KEY: {x = Completed} {r = Remove} {f = Future} {? = Unknown} {P = Partial}
//
//	- [] trigger_endmission might have a use only spawnflag > check line 124343
//	- [] Still working on `weapons` > 64 is no weps and no ammo 
//
//
//		:FUTURE:
//
// This is for things that will take awhile or are not really urgent.
//
//	- [?] Figure out what spawnflag 1 does on env_liveammoshooter.
//	- [f] Find a place for 'globalstate' to go on because it relates to CBaseToggle ents.	
//	- [?] Find out what spawnflag 1 does on trigger_endmission.
//	- [f] Make pigeon sounds for monster_flyer. < Pigeon sounds may already exist in the base game, just need to change the file names to 'boidxyz'.
//	- [?] Figure out what flag 2 does on trigger_sequence.
//	- [?] Fix 'weapon' and 'behavior' key choices on BaseClass Monster to properly reflect code. < I don't know if this works at all...
