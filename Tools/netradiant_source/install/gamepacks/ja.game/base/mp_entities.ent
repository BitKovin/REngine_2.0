The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

-------- NOTES --------
The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"
And this would turn it back off:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_off"

This entity is used specifically for the FA mode of MBII. Set idealclass as the name of the mbch (character) you wish to spawn at this location.You can target these points in order to enable/disable them. This allows you to trigger new sets of spawn points upon different events occurring on the map. There is also a "startoff" key, if you set it non-0 the spawn point will be disabled at the start until activated. 'Idealclass' key will specify the ideal class to spawn on this point, and the value should correspond to the name field in a .scl (or .mbch) file. Classes will first check for points that match their ideal class when spawning, and if they cannot find any, they will fall back to normal team spawn points.

Non-displayed point light source. The -pointscale and -scale arguments to Q3Map2 affect the brightness of these lights. The -skyscale argument affects brightness of entity sun lights.

By default, this entity works very similar to the power and style of an old-style incandescent light bulb (default power level is 300) in terms of how it radiates light and the power level.

To create a negative light (dark), set the number lower than 0


Spotlight:
If you want your lighting to feel like it is coming from a certain light source or you feel your lighting is filling an area too much and you only really want it in one area. To give your lighting more direction, Give your light entity an info_null target. This essentially 'focuses' the light in that direction, similar to the effect of a spotlight. Useful if you aren't wanting to get your light spilled around the area evenly but more-so want it focused in one direction. Unfortunately GTK can not show lighting effect in real time, so it is necessary to compile the map in order to observe the effect you have created. Sometimes it may take 3 or 4 attempts to achieve the result you want, adjusting the strength of the light source and the distance and angle from the info_null.

Key (for spotlight use only):

radius: sets radius of light cone for spotlights (default 64) in game units. Radius measurement is made at the targeted entity.

There are several ways a light entity can be colored:

With the entity window open, select a light entity in either the map or camera window. Press K. This brings up the windows color selector. Select a color and choose "OK". The editor automatically normalizes the light colors.
Sample Texture: Select the light entity. Select a texture in either the texture window or the camera window. Hit SHIFT + middle mouse button.
Manual Entry: Type in the value for the key _color as a 3 numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
Copy Existing: Select another light entity whose color value the user would like to duplicate. In the editor window, lef click on the key "_color". Now select the light entity to be colored. Hit ENTER.
If the "Light drawing" preference is selected (under Preferences), the editor shows the light entities as diamond shaped pieces the color of the light they cast.</color>

This is an entity coded for MBII and unfortunately may not work in base JKA.

This entity will fire weather effects in areas where there are misc_weather_zone and inside/outside brushes in the same way fx_rain, fx_snow, and fx_spacedust do.

Used in tandem with scripts, this is a powerful way to change weather in your map on the fly.

Doors that touch are NOT automatically teamed. If you want doors to operate together, you have to team them manually by assigning the same team value on all doors which you wish to open together at the same time.
When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by the origin brush.

When the entity activates its targets, all shaders/textures in the map that were originally the same name as the 'targetShaderName' value, will be changed to the 'targetShaderNewName' value. For example, turning a light on:
 "targetShaderName"    "textures/proto2/redlight_off"
 "targetShaderNewName" "textures/proto2/redlight_on"

-------- NOTES --------
Target this entity with a misc_model to have the model attached to the entity (set the model's "target" key to the same value as this entity's "targetname").

When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by the origin brush. If a model is included with a targeted func_static, the brush(es) of the entity will be removed from the game but the .md3 model won't: It will automatically be moved to the (0 0 0) world origin so you should NOT include an .md3 model to a targeted func_static. If an origin brush is used the you must select the origin brush first then all other brushes that make up this entity. Then create this entity.

Because the map has only a single bot navigation file, func_static cannot be used to make significant changes in game play flow between differing game types.


If non-visible brush is turned into a func_static and one of the force spawnflags are used the force influence (blue swirl force indicator thingy) doesn't show but is still force influence able.

If you want to create a model which is breakable, first place the model as a misc_model in the desired spot, then place a small cube brush within the direct origin (center) of it. This brush should have an origin shader. Then, delete the model (keeping of course the directory name of it) and convert that brush to a func_breakable. An alternative solution is also to create a clipping brush around that model which is a func_breakable.

==Additional RGB or Liquid Possibilities==

-------- tintLiquid --------
==Description==
'Custom' - Set to 1 in order to use the rest of the variables for the liquid type in question. If you use this. all of the variables need to be set, or will default to 0.0. The defaults listed below are for when Custom is 0, or the natural tint of each liquid.

'Amplitude' - Liquid tints waver back and forth between levels of transparency. Amplitude controls by how much. (The wavelength is hardcoded at 0.4 seconds and corresponds to the wavelength of the view-distortion that also occurs when looking through a liquid.)

'Offset' - This allows the center or baseline of the wave(Which maxes out at 1.0 and bottoms out at 0.0) to be adjusted higher or lower, weighting the amplitude of the wave towards one end or the other of the scale.

'R' - The red component of the liquid's tint. Between 0.0 and 1.0.

'G' - The green component of the liquid's tint. Between 0.0 and 1.0.

'B' - The blue component of the liquid's tint. Between 0.0 and 1.0.

Try to avoid using target_gravity very often:

There's a built-in rate limit of one change per second; a large number of changes in a short period of time can create an extensive amount of lag, and possibly cause crashes. Mappers should avoid situations where two or more target_gravity entities are "fighting" over what the gravity should be set to in a map.

MOVIE BATTLES SPECIFIC ENTITY

soundSetMin/Max defines the range of sounds to use within the sound set. Leave as is and all sounds should be played, but if you only 1 or 2 sounds, setting max lower will improve client performance (less likely to try an invalid sound). These settings are mostly intended to allow use of a subset of sounds for more variety in different areas, without needing to define duplicate soundSets.

soundSet is a defined set from sound.txt, and should be in func_door format:
bmodelSet kashyyyk_dist_creeps
subWaves ambience/kashyyyk DistCreeps01 DistCreeps02 DistCreeps03 DistCreeps04 DistCreeps05

-------- NOTES --------
The path portion value of the "noise" key can be replaced by the implicit folder character "*" for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For example, if you want to create a "bottomless pit" in which the player screams and dies when he falls into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the "noise" key to "*falling1.wav". The * character means the current player model's sound folder. So if your current player model is Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create "player-specific" triggered sounds in your levels.

The combination of the "wait" and "random" keys can be used to play non-looping sounds without requiring an activating trigger but both keys must be used together. The value of the "random" key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

The below strings can be used to activate behaviors for spawnscript/usescript/awakescript/painscript/fleescript/deathscript as a way to overwrite those default behaviors. From what I could tell, they NPC_Spawner sets no behavior by default, this is instead set within the .npc text asset itself.

To use this method, an example would be
Key:	spawnscript
Value:	idle

    default: whatever
    idle: Stand around, do abolutely nothing
    roam: Roam around, collect stuff
    walk: Crouch-Walk toward their goals
    run: Run toward their goals
    standshoot: Stay in one spot and shoot- duck when neccesary
    standguard: Wait around for an enemy
    patrol: Follow a path, looking for enemies
    huntkill: Track down enemies and kill them
    evade: Run from enemies
    evadeshoot: Run from enemies, shoot them if they hit you
    runshoot: Run to your goal and shoot enemy when possible
    defend: Defend an entity or spot?
    snipe: Stay hidden, shoot enemy only when have perfect shot and back turned
    combat: Attack, evade, use cover, move about, etc.  Full combat AI - id NPC code
    medic: Go for lowest health buddy, hide and heal him.
    takecover: Find nearest cover from enemies
    getammo: Go get some ammo
    advancefight: Go somewhere and fight along the way
    face: turn until facing desired angles
    wait: do nothing
    formation: Maintain a formation
    crouch: Crouch-walk toward their goals

The below strings can be used to activate behaviors for spawnscript/usescript/awakescript/painscript/fleescript/deathscript as a way to overwrite those default behaviors. From what I could tell, they NPC_Spawner sets no behavior by default, this is instead set within the .npc text asset itself.

To use this method, an example would be
Key:	spawnscript
Value:	idle

    default: whatever
    idle: Stand around, do abolutely nothing
    roam: Roam around, collect stuff
    walk: Crouch-Walk toward their goals
    run: Run toward their goals
    standshoot: Stay in one spot and shoot- duck when neccesary
    standguard: Wait around for an enemy

    huntkill: Track down enemies and kill them
    evade: Run from enemies
    evadeshoot: Run from enemies, shoot them if they hit you
    runshoot: Run to your goal and shoot enemy when possible
    defend: Defend an entity or spot?
    snipe: Stay hidden, shoot enemy only when have perfect shot and back turned
    combat: Attack, evade, use cover, move about, etc.  Full combat AI - id NPC code
    medic: Go for lowest health buddy, hide and heal him.
    takecover: Find nearest cover from enemies
    getammo: Go get some ammo
    advancefight: Go somewhere and fight along the way
    face: turn until facing desired angles
    wait: do nothing
    formation: Maintain a formation
    crouch: Crouch-walk toward their goals

The below strings can be used to activate behaviors for spawnscript/usescript/awakescript/painscript/fleescript/deathscript as a way to overwrite those default behaviors. From what I could tell, they NPC_Spawner sets no behavior by default, this is instead set within the .npc text asset itself.

To use this method, an example would be
Key:	spawnscript
Value:	idle

    default: whatever
    idle: Stand around, do abolutely nothing

    huntkill: Track down enemies and kill them
    evade: Run from enemies
    evadeshoot: Run from enemies, shoot them if they hit you
    runshoot: Run to your goal and shoot enemy when possible
    defend: Defend an entity or spot?
    snipe: Stay hidden, shoot enemy only when have perfect shot and back turned
    combat: Attack, evade, use cover, move about, etc.  Full combat AI - id NPC code
    medic: Go for lowest health buddy, hide and heal him.
    takecover: Find nearest cover from enemies
    getammo: Go get some ammo
    advancefight: Go somewhere and fight along the way
    face: turn until facing desired angles
    wait: do nothing

To use this method, an example would be

    default: whatever
    idle: Stand around, do abolutely nothing

The below strings can be used to activate behaviors for spawnscript/usescript/awakescript/painscript/fleescript/deathscript as a way to overwrite those default behaviors. From what I could tell, they NPC_Spawner sets no behavior by default, this is instead set within the .npc text asset itself.

To use this method, an example would be
Key:	spawnscript
Value:	idle

    default: whatever
    idle: Stand around, do abolutely nothing
    roam: Roam around, collect stuff
    walk: Crouch-Walk toward their goals
    run: Run toward their goals
    standshoot: Stay in one spot and shoot- duck when neccesary
    standguard: Wait around for an enemy
    patrol: Follow a path, looking for enemies
    huntkill: Track down enemies and kill them
    evade: Run from enemies
    evadeshoot: Run from enemies, shoot them if they hit you
    runshoot: Run to your goal and shoot enemy when possible
    defend: Defend an entity or spot?
    snipe: Stay hidden, shoot enemy only when have perfect shot and back turned
    combat: Attack, evade, use cover, move about, etc.  Full combat AI - id NPC code
    medic: Go for lowest health buddy, hide and heal him.
    takecover: Find nearest cover from enemies
    getammo: Go get some ammo
    advancefight: Go somewhere and fight along the way
    face: turn until facing desired angles
    wait: do nothing
    formation: Maintain a formation

-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies a decal to be projected. Should contain 1 or more patch meshes (curves) and target an info_null entity. Patch mesh should be using a shader which includes "polygonoffset" (or other blending methods) or else z-fighting will occur. The distance between the center of the _decal entity and the target is the axis and distance of projection. Imagine it as if this entity is the projector and the info_null is where the image is projected.
